# Traffic Sign Classification using LeNet-5

This is my Final Year Project at COMSATS University, where I developed and deployed a deep learning model for **Pakistani traffic sign classification** using the LeNet-5 architecture.

---

## Highlights
- Built a **custom dataset** of 12 Pakistani traffic sign classes
- Applied preprocessing: Resizing, grayscale, histogram equalization, augmentation
- Achieved **91% accuracy** on our final trained model
- Trained first on **GTSRB dataset** (97.95% accuracy), then transferred to local dataset
- Deployed using **TensorFlow Lite** on **Raspberry Pi 3** for real-time classification
- Won **1st Position at COMSATS EXPO 2024**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Challenges
- Signs with similar structure sometimes confused the model (e.g. Danger vs Traffic Signal Ahead)
- Accuracy improved significantly after augmentation and dataset expansion
